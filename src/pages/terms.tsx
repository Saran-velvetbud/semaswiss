                                 In operating the Site, we may act as a "services provider" (as defined by DMCA) and offer services as an online provider of materials and links to third party websites. As a result, third party materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed or otherwise made available while using the Site. Sema Swiss has in place certain legally mandated procedures regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Site.
